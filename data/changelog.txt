==================
engine changes

==================
 gameplay changes 
==================

- when listing monsters, you can now let time pass and see it approaching you, 
  cursor gets locked on currently selected monster and can follow as monster is approaching 
  player.  
- new player overlay indicate when you're being seen by monsters. so you walk 
  around, and you'll be warned if hostiles took notice of you.

==================
planned changes
==================

- no more "auto-combat"
- when looking at a monster an additionnal arrow shown near screen borders displaying the 
  player direction, relative to the monster currently being "listed" but only if it's 
  farther than the player screen visibility. that arrow will just point to the general 
  direction: N-S-E-W and diagonals too.
- showing roofs by default, player will get to see the interiors of buildings only when
  entering them. i will probably try to make the interiors darker too (no eletricity: less light).
